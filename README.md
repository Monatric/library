# Project: Library

This is a simple project for JavaScript, a small library app [guided by The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-library). The primary focus of the learning outcomes here is JavaScript's objects, object prototypes, and constructors.

## Learning Outcomes

- Used JS constructors to build objects
- Used prototypes to build functions for Book
- Used `<dialog>` to build a form for adding books
- Used `data-attribute` as a way to delete books
- Displayed and removed books in a card dynamically using JS `fragments` and creating elements, acting like a component
